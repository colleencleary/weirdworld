  ABOUT WEIRD WORLD - Our Weird World application is the ultimate traveler guide for those who want to take their trip to the next level. We all know what being a tourist is like, the famous restaurants, landscapes, buildings, etc., But what if you are looking to make your trip a bit more awesome and less touristy? We have made the perfect travel guide for you! Weird World allows users to search attractions that are not of the normal hot spot and tourist trap variety. Visit places that only the locals know about, the hidden gems of every city, the places that you may just happen upon by accident. Weird World allows you to search for attractions in your area, add an attraction that you happen to find, and comment your thoughts and tips about your recent visit!

  OUR MISSION - To deploy an application that allowed users to expand their weird horizons and take a walk on the unconventional side. We wanted to create a tool that was easily accessible with user friendly features and also brings the public together to add their weird and fun finds.
